        Hello! <br>
                My name is Daniela Mata. <br> I am in the STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) academy at my school. I'm heading into a science, or possibly, technology field. <br><br>
                Random Facts: <br><br>I like to draw and love to play games in my freetime, some games I like to play are:<br>     1. Red Dead Redmption 2<br>    2. Friday the 13th<br>     3. Assasin Creed (I have played some of them,but not all) 
                <br> However, I havent played any of them in a while because of how busy I am with schoolwork.
                <br><br> I started taking orchestra in 6th grade and I play the violin ever since. <br>I plan to keep this class until I graduate High School. 
                <br><br> Currently, I am in the top 10% of my class rank <br>
                (Ran out of things to type here, sorry) <br>
